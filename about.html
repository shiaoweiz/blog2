                  <h2>Hi, my name is Shiaowei</h2> <br>
                    <span>I am 19 years old, and I'm from Connecticut. <br>
                      All I ever wanted since I gained consciousness as a baby was to travel the world. 
                      I think that there are a lot of “made-up” things in this world <br>
                      (money, the job market, politics, etc) and although they are weaved into all parts of modern life, I do not find much importance and meaning in all of it. <br>
                      This planet and its people is what I consider to be “real” so I want to see as much of it as I can, while meeting people from communities everywhere.</span> <br>
                    <span>This is my blog that documents a few of my memories. enjoy!</span> <br>
